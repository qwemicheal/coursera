  /** Returns a list of all anagram sentences of the given sentence.
    *
    *  An anagram of a sentence is formed by taking the occurrences of all the characters of
    *  all the words in the sentence, and producing all possible combinations of words with those characters,
    *  such that the words have to be from the dictionary.
    *
    *  The number of words in the sentence and its anagrams does not have to correspond.
    *  For example, the sentence `List("I", "love", "you")` is an anagram of the sentence `List("You", "olive")`.
    *
    *  Also, two sentences with the same words but in a different order are considered two different anagrams.
    *  For example, sentences `List("You", "olive")` and `List("olive", "you")` are different anagrams of
    *  `List("I", "love", "you")`.
    *
    *  Here is a full example of a sentence `List("Yes", "man")` and its anagrams for our dictionary:
    *
    *    List(
    *      List(en, as, my),
    *      List(en, my, as),
    *      List(man, yes),
    *      List(men, say),
    *      List(as, en, my),
    *      List(as, my, en),
    *      List(sane, my),
    *      List(Sean, my),
    *      List(my, en, as),
    *      List(my, as, en),
    *      List(my, sane),
    *      List(my, Sean),
    *      List(say, men),
    *      List(yes, man)
    *    )
    *
    *  The different sentences do not have to be output in the order shown above - any order is fine as long as
    *  all the anagrams are there. Every returned word has to exist in the dictionary.
    *
    *  Note: in case that the words of the sentence are in the dictionary, then the sentence is the anagram of itself,
    *  so it has to be returned in this list.
    *
    *  Note: There is only one anagram of an empty sentence.
