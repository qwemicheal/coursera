This repo is created for storing all the code I wrote for the coursera scala courses homework in the past monthes. I have finished three of them:Functional Programming Principles in Scala,Functional Program Design in Scala,Parallel programming.Some code may be incomplete because I did some of the coding in workplace where I didn't synchronize with the home pc. Also this repo serve as my experimental place as i am formally learning git.
